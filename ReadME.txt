John Rodriguez SBA 319 MongoDB and Mongoose. 
Created a Yugioh card Data Base On MongoDb called YUGI_OH.With a simple a Schema. 
All Crud functions, tested through Postman. Feel free to add some cards/names and cardTypes are Required. The challenge was how exactly to access the sample data through mongoose,oddly confusing
So I would like to see a walkthrough on that. So I can mess with all the samples.
